Uber Coding Challenge : Food Trucks
===================================

For my Uber coding challenge project I decided to do the Food Trucks problem. 
It is hosted at http://floating-everglades-8049.herokuapp.com. For the frontend 
I chose to use Backbone.js and for the backend I use flask with a mongodb database.
